# shrc.d

I used to have a single file `~/.shrc` which contained things that should be sourced by both bash and zsh. It became too big, so now I use this directory instead to organize things a bit better.

Files with the `.sh` extension are loaded in alphabetical order, so use number prefixes to control which files are loaded in what order.
